_What is ChatBot?_

- A simple and easy to use script to create a bot.

There are generated responses that you can set for welcoming users and telling them goodbye.


_To Do_

- Make the bot deployable to different sites
- "Teach" the bot 
- Allow multiple URLs to be passed 
- Allow the user to pass URLs
